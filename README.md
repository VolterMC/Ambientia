# Ambientia
Implementation of ambient monitor backlighting with Corsair RGB LED Strips, using RGB.NET. 

Everything of interest is (as of now) in the Program.cs file.

The implementation works with 4 Corsair RGB LED Strips (10 diodes each), but it is prepared for 6 strips in case if anyone got 2 spare strips from another set.
